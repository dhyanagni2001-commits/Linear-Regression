# Linear Regression

This project implements **linear regression** from scratch using Python and NumPy. It covers basic linear regression, regularized linear regression, hyperparameter tuning, and polynomial feature mapping. Model performance is evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

---

## Project Overview
- Implements linear regression without regularization
- Adds L2-regularized linear regression
- Tunes the regularization parameter (lambda)
- Extends linear regression to polynomial regression
- Evaluates models using Mean Squared Error

---

## Implementation Details
All implementation is done in:
- `linear_regression.py`

Only this file is modified and graded.

---

## Features Implemented
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** computation
- **Linear Regression (No Regularization)**
- **Regularized Linear Regression (L2 / Ridge)**
- **Regularization Parameter Tuning**
- **Polynomial Feature Mapping (No Cross Terms)**

---

## How to Run
```bash
python linear_regression_test.py
